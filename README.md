# Memory Game Project

An application that runs the well-known game _Concentration_!

## How To Play

_Concentration_ is played by selecting two cards. Clicking on two cards will flip them up. If both cards match, they stay faced up. If they don't, they get flipped down and you have to try again.

### Win condition

If all the cards are matched before the timer ends, you win the game and a screen will pop up showing your stats. If the timer runs out before you can match all the cards, you lose and a screen will pop up giving you the option to try again.

## Features

### Turn counter

The game will keep track of how many attempts you make at matching cards and display this information for you at the top of the card table.

### Rating system

A star rating system is in place to rate your performance. The less turns you take, the higher the star rating at the conclusion of the game. You can see your rating as you play the game at the top of the card table. The rating system will take into account the size of the game setup when evaluating your performance.

## Dynamic Game Setup

The game is built to be responsive across different devices. On smaller devices, such as mobile phones and small-sized tablets, the game follows a 3x4 setup. On bigger devices, such as large tablets and desktop computers, the game dynamically changes to follow a 4x4 setup.
